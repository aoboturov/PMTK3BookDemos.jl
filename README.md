# PMTK4BookDemos

Julia implementation of the Kevin Murphy's textbook [Machine learning: a probabilistic perspective](http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook). Based on [PMTK3](https://github.com/probml/pmtk3) `pmtk3/demos`.

## Dependencies

It is required to get the following packages (untill they would not be published):

- [PMTK4Stats.jl](https://github.com/aoboturov/PMTK4Stats.jl)
- [PMTK4BasicModels.jl](https://github.com/aoboturov/PMTK4BasicModels.jl)

See [Pkg.clone()](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/packages/#making-your-package-available) in Julialang documentation for instructions on package cloning.

## Usage

One could use `draw(SVG("$fileName.svg", 20cm, 15cm), pp)` to save plots generated by `pp = draw*` functions.
Otherwise plots could be opened automatically in the web browser by Julia.
Or `display(pp)` to just show it.
